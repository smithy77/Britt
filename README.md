# Github Assignment || MAGD 150
### Brittany Smith

* [Lab Assignment 1](https://github.com/smithy77/magd150/blob/master/s19magd150lab01_Smith.pde)
 The theme for this assignment was buildings, and we essentially created shapes in greyscale that were to follow the theme.
* [Lab Assignment 2](https://github.com/smithy77/magd150/blob/master/s19magd150lab02_Smith.pde)
 The theme for this assignment was planets/space, and we were to use non-basic shapes(such as Bezier Curve, Arc, etc.) in a colormode, so they were not just black and white.
* [Lab Assignment 4](https://github.com/smithy77/magd150/blob/master/s19magd150lab04_Smith.pde)
 The theme for this assignment was pizza, and we were to create something within the theme that had commands such as mousePressed and keyPressed. It also had to contain some kind of loop.
* [Lab Assignment 5](https://github.com/smithy77/magd150/blob/master/s19magd150lab05_Smith.pde)
 The theme for this assignment was alternate dimensions, and we were to create two buttons of different shapes and functions that adhered to the theme.
* [Lab Assignment 6](https://github.com/smithy77/magd150/blob/master/s19magd150lab06_Smith.pde)
 The theme for this assignment was retro games, and it was meant to have three functions/features we learned in lab. We also had to create a class for this assignment.
